                [Intro]<br>
                Far from their land as they made their stand<br>
                They stood strong and the legend still lives on<br>
                <br>
                [Verse 1]<br>
                1918 the Great War rages on<br>
                A battalion is lost in the Argonne<br>
                Under fire there's nothing they can do<br>
                There's no way they can get a message through<br>
                Suffer heavy losses as the battle carries on<br>
                Liberty Division standing strong<br>
                <br>
                [Hook]<br>
                Far from their land as they made their stand<br>
                A disregarded demand<br>
                It's surrender or die and the stakes are high<br>
                They live or they die, there's no time for goodbye<br>
                Weapon in hand as they made their stand<br>
                Still disregarding demand<br>
                They would never comply, they would rather die<br>
                Broke through the blockade, they were finally saved<br>
                <br>
                [Verse 2]<br>
                Friendly fire, munitions running low<br>
                The supplies, they were dropped upon their foe<br>
                1918 the war still rages on<br>
                The battalion still trapped in the Argonne<br>
                Chose not to surrender, they chose victory or defeat<br>
                Fallen brothers resting by their feet<br>
                [Hook]<br>
                Far from their land as they made their stand<br>
                A disregarded demand<br>
                It's surrender or die and the stakes are high<br>
                They live or they die, there's no time for goodbye<br>
                Weapon in hand as they made their stand<br>
                Still disregarding demand<br>
                They would never comply, they would rather die<br>
                Broke through the blockade, they were finally saved<br>

                Far from their land as they made their stand<br>
                A disregarded demand<br>
                It's surrender or die and the stakes are high<br>
                Live or die, who can tell there's no goodbye<br>
                With a weapon in hand as they made their stand<br>
                Still disregarding demand<br>
                They would never comply, they would rather die<br>
                They stood strong and the legend still lives on<br>
                <br>
                [Bridge]<br>
                Suffered heavy losses through the Great War they stood strong<br>
                But the memory of the fallen still lives on<br>
                [Hook]<br>
                Far from their land as they made their stand<br>
                A disregarded demand<br>
                It's surrender or die and the stakes are high<br>
                They live or they die, there's no time for goodbye<br>
